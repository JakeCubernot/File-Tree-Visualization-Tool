# File Tree Visualization Tool

This Python tool generates a visual representation of the file structure in a directory and outputs it to a `.txt` file. It recursively traverses the directory tree and creates an indented structure to represent all files and folders.

## Features

- Recursively lists all files and directories starting from the directory where the script is run.
- Outputs the file tree as an indented visual structure to a `file_tree.txt` file.
- Can be used for any directory to get a clear overview of its contents.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x or higher.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the script file.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/File-Tree-Visualization-Tool.git
